# HA-AuthCode-Generation-Service (CovidCode-Service)
HA-AuthCode-Generation-Service is an authorization code generation service for the CovidCode-UI and the proximity tracing app.

# Developer Instructions

## Initial setup

Do this once:

1. Install a JDK (tested with Oracle JDK v11 and OpenjDK 1.8.0)
1. [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
1. Check out [CovidCode-UI](https://github.com/admin-ch/CovidCode-UI) in another directory

## Development Cycle

Do this at the beginning of your session:
1. Run <pre>docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f</pre> and wait for the logs to become quiescent
1. Run CovidCode-UI in another window (`ng serve`)

To run manual tests, you can run CovidCode-Service with the `local`
and `keycloak-local` Spring profiles using the following command:
```
mvn compile exec:java
```
(or the equivalent using your IDE's Maven functionality, if you
require access to a debugger)

To run the test suite:
```
mvn verify
```

To perform a clean build, and run the test suite with full code coverage
and upload the data to a locally-running SonarQube:
```
mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent verify sonar:sonar
```
SonarQube results are thereafter visible at http://localhost:9000/

To tear down the development support environment (but retain its state on-disk):
```
docker-compose down
```

To wipe everything:
```
docker-compose down
docker volume rm covidcode_dbdata
mvn clean
```

## Swagger-UI
Swagger-UI is running on http://localhost:8113/swagger-ui.html.

## Local KeyCloak instance

If CovidCode-Service is being run as suggested above, it will perform
authentication and access control against an OIDC / OAuth server
running on http://localhost:8180/ (and so will CovidCode-UI in its
default development configuration).

The credentials for the KeyCloak administrator are visible in
docker-compose.yml in section `keycloak:`. Additionally, KeyCloak is
automatically pre-populated with a `bag-pts` realm, containing a
`doctor` account (password `doctor`) that enjoys access to both
CovidCode-UI and CovidCode-Service.

## PostgreSQL database

docker-compose runs a new PostgreSQL database on port 3113 and takes
care of setting it up. The superuser credentials are in
`docker-compose.yml`.

The "local" Spring profile should be used to run the application (see above).
The other profiles run the script afterMigrate to reassign the owner of the objects.

### Dockerfile
The docker file is provided only to run the application locally without DB. This configuration starts a PostgreSQL 11 on port 3113.

## JWT Generation
JWT generation uses a custom generator with library JJWT.

## Lombok
Project uses Lombok. Configure your IDE with lombok plugin.

## Security
The API is secured and a valid JWT should be provided. Note that these 2 values are needed  
- ctx:USER
- the audience must be set to ha-authcodegeneration
 
## Configuration
These parameters can be configured. You can find example values in application-local.yml.

The validity of the generated JWT:  
authcodegeneration.jwt.token-validity

The issuer to set in the generated JWT:  
authcodegeneration.jwt.issuer

The private key to sign the generated JWT:  
authcodegeneration.jwt.privateKey

The Prometheus actuator endpoint is secured with username and password:  
authcodegeneration.monitor.prometheus.user  
authcodegeneration.monitor.prometheus.password

The allowed origin configuration for the authcode generation:  
ha-authcode-generation-service.allowed-origin
